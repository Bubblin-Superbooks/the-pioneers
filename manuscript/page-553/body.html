<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I was down in the Dutch settlements on the Schoharie,&rdquo; said Natty, carefully removing the leather guard from the lock of his rifle, &ldquo;just before the breaking out of the last war, and there was a shooting-match among the boys; so I took a hand. I think I opened a good many Dutch eyes that day; for I won the powder-horn, three bars of lead, and a pound of as good powder as ever flashed in pan. Lord! how they did swear in Jarman! They did tell me of one drunken Dutchman who said he'd have the life of me before I got back to the lake agin. But if he had put his rifle to his shoulder with evil intent God would have punished him for it; and even if the Lord didn't, and he had missed his aim, I know one that would have given him as good as he sent, and better too, if good shooting could come into the 'count.</p></div> </div>
