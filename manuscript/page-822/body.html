If I might offer my self as a protector&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does my father select Mr. Oliver Edwards as the organ of his displeasure?&rdquo; interrupted the lady.</p><p>&ldquo;Good Heaven! you misunderstood my meaning; I should have said uneasy or not pleased. I am his servant, madam, and in consequence yours. I repeat that, with your consent, I will change my rod for a fowling-piece, and keep nigh you on the mountain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Edwards; but where there is no danger, no protection is required. We are not yet reduced to wandering among these free hills accompanied by a body guard. If such a one is necessary there he is, however.</p></div> </div>
