<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How is this managed in France, Monsieur Le Quoi? Do you let everybody run over your land in that country helter-skelter, as they do here, shooting the game, so that a gentleman has but little or no chance with his gun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! diable, no, Meester Deeck,&rdquo; replied the Frenchman; &ldquo;we give, in France, no liberty except to the ladi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, to the women, I know,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;that is your Salic law. I read, sir, all kinds of books; of France, as well as England; of Greece, as well as Rome. But if I were in 'Duke's place, I would stick up advertisements to-morrow morning, forbidding all persons to shoot, or trespass in any manner, on my woods. I could write such an advertisement myself, in an hour, as would put a stop to the thing at once.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
