<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Thou sayest well, Leather-Stocking,&rdquo; cried Marmaduke, &ldquo;and I begin to think it time to put an end to this work of destruction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Put an ind, Judge, to your clearings. Ain't the woods His work as well as the pigeons? Use, but don't waste. Wasn't the woods made for the beasts and birds to harbor in? and when man wanted their flesh, their skins, or their feathers, there's the place to seek them. But I'll go to the hut with my own game, for I wouldn't touch one of the harmless things that cover the ground here, looking up with their eyes on me, as if they only wanted tongues to say their thoughts.&rdquo; With this sentiment in his month, Leather-Stocking threw his rifle over his arm, and, followed by his dogs, stepped across the clearing with great caution, taking care not to tread on one of the wounded birds in his path. He soon entered the bushes on the margin of the lake and was hid from view.</p></div> </div>
