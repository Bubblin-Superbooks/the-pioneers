<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What's that, old corn-stalk! you sapless stub!&rdquo; cried the wood-chopper. &ldquo;You have grown wordy, since the affair of the turkey; but if you are for a single shot, here goes at that bird which comes on by himself.&rdquo;</p><p>The fire from the distant part of the field had driven a single pigeon below the flock to which it belonged, and, frightened with the constant reports of the muskets, it was approaching the spot where the disputants stood, darting first from One side and then to the other, cutting the air with the swiftness of lightning, and making a noise with its wings not unlike the rushing of a bullet. Unfortunately for the wood-chopper, notwithstanding his vaunt, he did not see this bird until it was too late to fire as it approached, and he pulled the trigger at the unlucky moment when it was darting immediately over his head. The bird continued its course with the usual velocity.</p></div> </div>
