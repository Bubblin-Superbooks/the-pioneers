I say, old sharpshooter, she may have pretty bones, but I can't say so much for her flesh, d'ye see, for she looks somewhat like anatomy with another man's jacket on. Now for the skin of her face, it's all the same as a new topsail with a taut bolt-rope, being snug at the leeches, but all in a bight about the inner cloths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;I command you to be silent, sir!&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, ma'am,&rdquo; returned the steward. &ldquo;You didn't say I shouldn't drink, though.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
