<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will submit,&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;I will forget who I am. Cease to remember, old Mohegan, that I am the descendant of a Delaware chief, who once was master of these noble hills, these beautiful vales, and of this water, over which we tread. Yes, yes; I will become his bonds man&mdash;his slave, Is it not an honorable servitude, old man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Old man!&rdquo; repeated the Indian solemnly, and pausing in his walk, as usual, when much excited; &ldquo;yes, John is old. Son of my brother! if Mohegan was young, when would his rifle be still? Where would the deer hide, and he not find him? But John is old; his hand is the hand of a squaw; his tomahawk is a hatchet; brooms and baskets are his enemies&mdash;he strikes no other. Hunger and old age come together.</p></div> </div>
