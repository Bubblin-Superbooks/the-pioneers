<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the singular ways of this Natty spoken of, Miss Temple? They say that, in his youth, he was an Indian warrior; or, what is the same thing, a white man leagued with the savages; and it is thought he has been concerned in many of their inroads, in the old wars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The thing is not at all improbable,&rdquo; returned Elizabeth; &ldquo;he is not alone in that particular.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, surely; but is it not strange that he is so cautious with his hut? He never leaves it, without fastening it in a remarkable manner; and in several instances, when the children, or even the men of the village, have wished to seek a shelter there from the storms, he has been known to drive them from his door with rudeness and threats. That surely is singular to this country!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
