<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And where was that?&rdquo; inquired Edwards, whose curiosity was strongly excited by the simple description of the hunter.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, there's a fall in the hills where the water of two little ponds. that lie near each other, breaks out of their bounds and runs over the rocks into the valley. The stream is, maybe, such a one as would turn a mill, if so useless thing was wanted in the wilderness. But the hand that made that 'Leap' never made a mill. There the water comes crooking and winding among the rocks, first so slow that a trout could swim in it, and then starting and running like a creatur' that wanted to make a far spring, till it gets to where the mountain divides, like the cleft hoof of a deer, leaving a deep hollow for the brook to tumble into.</p></div> </div>
