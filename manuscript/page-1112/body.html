<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Surely, sir,&rdquo; cried the impatient Elizabeth, &ldquo;those laws that condemn a man like the Leather-Stocking to so severe a punishment, for an offence that even I must think very venial, cannot be perfect in themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou talkest of what thou dost not understand, Elizabeth,&rdquo; returned her father. &ldquo;Society cannot exist without wholesome restraints. Those restraints cannot be inflicted without security and respect to the persons of those who administer them; and it would sound ill indeed to report that a judge had extended favor to a convicted criminal, because he had saved the life of his child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see the difficulty of your situation, dear sir,&rdquo; cried the daughter; &ldquo;but, in appreciating the offence of poor Natty, I cannot separate the minister of the law from the man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
