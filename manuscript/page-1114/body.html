Go to the prison&mdash;there are none in this pace to harm thee&mdash;give this note to the jailer, and, when thou seest Bumppo, say what thou wilt to the poor old man; give scope to the feeling of thy warm heart; but try to remember, Elizabeth, that the laws alone remove us from the condition of the savages; that he has been criminal, and that his judge was thy father.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
