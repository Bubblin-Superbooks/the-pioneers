Master Benjamin, you were asleep, were you? but I'll set down no such slander against an orthodox divine.&rdquo; Richard wrote twenty-nine minutes in his journal, and continued: &ldquo;Why, what's this you've got opposite ten o'clock A.M.? A full moon! had you a moon visible by day? I have heard of such portents before now, but&mdash;eh! what's this alongside of it? an hour-glass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; said Benjamin, looking coolly over the sheriff's shoulder, and rolling the tobacco about in his mouth with a jocular air; &ldquo;why, that's a small matter of my own. It's no moon, squire, but only Betty Hollister's face; for, dye see, sir, hearing all the same as if she had got up a new cargo of Jamaiky from the river, I called in as I was going to the church this morning&mdash;ten A.M.</p></div> </div>
