<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It has been already said that the &ldquo;court of common pleas and general sessions of the peace,&rdquo; or, as it is commonly called, the &ldquo;county court,&rdquo; over which Judge Temple presided, held one of its stated sessions on the following morning.
