Haul in, and here's a cast that will pay for the labor.&rdquo; Fishes of various sorts were now to be seen, entangled in the meshes of the net, as it was passed through the hands of the laborers; and the water, at a little distance from the shore, was alive with the movements of the alarmed victims. Hundreds of white sides were glancing up to the surface of the water, and glistening in the fire light, when, frightened at the uproar and the change, the fish would again dart to the bottom, in fruitless efforts for freedom. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Richard: &ldquo;one or two more heavy drags, boys, and we are safe.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
