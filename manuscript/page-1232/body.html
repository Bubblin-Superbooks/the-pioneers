I look&mdash;but I see no white-skins; there are none to be seen but just and brave Indians.

Let the bow, and tomahawk, and pipe, and the wampum of Mohegan he laid in his grave; for when he starts 'twil be in the night, like a warrior on a war-party, and he can not stop to seek them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What says he, Nathaniel?&rdquo; cried Mr. Grant, earnestly, and with obvious anxiety; &ldquo;does he recall the promises of the mediation? and trust his salvation to the Rock of Ages?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
