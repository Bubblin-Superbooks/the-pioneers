<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We will not speak of what is to become of others,&rdquo; said Miss Temple, turning again to the hunter&mdash;&ldquo;but of your own fortunes, Natty. It shall be my care to see that you pass the rest of your days in ease and plenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ease and plenty!&rdquo; again repeated the Leather-Stocking; &ldquo;what ease can there be to an old man, who must walk a mile across the open fields, before he can find a shade to hide him from a scorching sun! or what plenty is there where you hunt a day, and not start a buck, or see anything bigger than a mink, or maybe a stray fox! Ah! I shall have a hard time after them very beavers, for this fine. I must go low toward the Pennsylvania line in search of the creatures, maybe a hundred mile; for they are not to be got here-away.</p></div> </div>
