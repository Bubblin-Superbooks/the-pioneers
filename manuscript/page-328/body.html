He was of a tall, gaunt formation, with rather sharp features, and a face that expressed formal propriety mingled with low cunning. Richard approached him, followed by Monsieur Le Quoi and the major-domo.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-evening, squire,&rdquo; said Richard, bobbing his head, but without moving his hands from his pockets.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-evening, squire,&rdquo; echoed Hiram, turning his body in order to turn his head also.</p><p>&ldquo;A cold night, Mr. Doolittle, a cold night, sir.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
