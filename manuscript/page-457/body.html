<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A thriving trade, Mrs. Hollister,&rdquo; said Marmaduke. &ldquo;But what has become of Richard? he jumped up as soon as seated, and has been absent so long that I am really fearful he has frozen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No fear of that, Cousin 'Duke,&rdquo; cried the gentleman himself; &ldquo;business will sometimes keep a man warm the coldest night that ever snapt in the mountains. Betty, your husband told me, as we came out of church, that your hogs were getting mangy, and so I have been out to take a look at them, and found it true. I stepped across, doctor, and got your boy to weigh me out a pound of salts, and have been mixing it with their swill. I'll bet a saddle of venison against a gray squirrel that they are better in a week. And now, Mrs. Hollister, I'm ready for a hissing mug of flip.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
