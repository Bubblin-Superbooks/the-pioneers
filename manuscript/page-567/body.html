<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A merry Christmas to you, Cousin Dickon,&rdquo; said Judge Temple, who had approached the party unperceived: &ldquo;I must have a vigilant eye to my daughter, sir, if you are to be seized daily with these gallant fits. I admire the taste which would introduce a lady to such scenes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is her own perversity, 'Duke,&rdquo; cried the disappointed sheriff, who felt the loss of the first salutation as grievously as many a man would a much greater misfortune; &ldquo;and I must say that she comes honestly by it. I led her out to show her the improvements, but away she scampered, through the snow, at the first sound of fire-arms, the same as if she had been brought up in a camp, instead of a first-rate boarding-school. I do think, Judge Temple, that such dangerous amusements should be suppressed, by statute; nay, I doubt whether they are not already indict able at common law.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
