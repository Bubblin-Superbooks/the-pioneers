<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I keep no books,&rdquo; said Natty, a little coldly; &ldquo;not such a Bible as the law needs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! there's but one sort of Bible that's good in law,&rdquo; returned the magistrate, &ldquo;and your'n will do as well as another's. Come, the carcasses are worth nothing, man; let us go down and take the oath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Softly, softly, squire,&rdquo; said the hunter, lifting his trophies very deliberately from the ground, and shouldering his rifle; &ldquo;why do you want an oath at all, for a thing that your own eyes has seen? Won't you believe yourself, that another man must swear to a fact that you know to be true? You have seen me scalp the creatur's, and if I must swear to it, it shall be before Judge Temple, who needs an oath.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
