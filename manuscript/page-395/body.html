The sin of the wrongs which have been done to the natives is shared by Judge Temple only in common with a whole people, and your arm will speedily be restored to its strength.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This arm!&rdquo; repeated the youth, pacing the floor in violent agitation. &ldquo;Think you, sir, that I believe the man a murderer? Oh, no! he is too wily, too cowardly, for such a crime. But let him and his daughter riot in their wealth&mdash;a day of retribution will come.</p></div> </div>
