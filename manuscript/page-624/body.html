There is not a better hand over a kettle in the county than that same Kirby. You remember, 'Duke, that I had him his first season in our camp; and it is not a wonder that he knows something of his trade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He's a good chopper, is Billy,&rdquo; observed Benjamin, who held the bridle of the horse while the sheriff mounted; &ldquo;and he handles an axe much the same as a forecastleman does his marling-spike, or a tailor his goose. They say he'll lift a potash-kettle off the arch alone, though I can't say that I've ever seen him do it with my own eyes; but that is the say.</p></div> </div>
