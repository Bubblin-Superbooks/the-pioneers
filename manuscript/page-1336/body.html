For my sake, if not for your own, stay. I shall see you in those frightful dreams that still haunt my nights, dying in poverty and age, by the side of those terrific beasts you slew. There will be no evil, that sickness, want, and solitude can inflict, that my fancy will not conjure as your fate. Stay with us, old man, if not for your own sake, at least for ours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Such thoughts and bitter dreams, Madam Effingham,&rdquo; returned the hunter, solemnly, &ldquo;will never haunt an innocent parson long. They'll pass away with God's pleasure.</p></div> </div>
