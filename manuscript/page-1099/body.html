It was a jesuitical, cold, unfeeling, and selfish manner, that seemed to say, &ldquo;I have kept within the law,&rdquo; to the man he had so cruelly injured. It quite overcame the restraint that the old hunter had been laboring to impose on himself, and he burst out in a warm glow of indignation.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should the rain fall from the clouds,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;when you force the tears from the eyes of the old, the sick, and the poor! Away with ye&mdash;away with ye! you may be formed in the image of the Maker, but Satan dwells in your heart. Away with ye, I say! I am mournful, and the sight of ye brings bitter thoughts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
