What Mingo that he chased ever sang the song of triumph? Did Mohegan ever he? No; the truth lived in him, and none else could come out of him. In his youth he was a warrior, and his moccasins left the stain of blood. In his age he was wise; his words at the council fire did not blow away with the winds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! he has abandoned that vain relic of paganism, his songs,&rdquo; cried the divine; &ldquo;what says he now? is he sensible of his lost state?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
