<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My private feelings must not enter into&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hear me, Marmaduke Temple,&rdquo; interrupted the old man, with melancholy earnestness, &ldquo;and hear reason. I've travelled these mountains when you was no judge, but an infant in your mother's arms; and I feel as if I had a right and a privilege to travel them agin afore I die. Have you forgot the time that you come on to the lake shore, when there wasn't even a jail to lodge in: and didn't I give you my own bear-skin to sleep on, and the fat of a noble buck to satisfy the cravings of your hunger? Yes, yes&mdash;you thought it no sin then to kill a deer! And this I did, though I had no reason to love you, for you had never done anything but harm to them that loved and sheltered me.</p></div> </div>
