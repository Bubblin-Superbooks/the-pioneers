And now I thought was the time to get a little comfort in the close of my days. Woods! indeed! I doesn't call these woods, Madam Effingham, where I lose myself every day of my life in the clearings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If there be anything wanting to your comfort, name it, Leather-Stocking; if it be attainable it is yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean all for the best, lad, I know; and so does madam, too; but your ways isn't my ways.
