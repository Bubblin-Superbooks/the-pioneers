The Mingo warriors were made squaws. When did he ever shoot twice? The eagle went above the clouds when he passed the wigwam of Chingachgook; his feathers were plenty with the women. But see,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice from the low, mournful tones in which he had spoken to a pitch of keen excitement, and stretching forth both hands, &ldquo;they shake like a deer at the wolf's howl. Is John old? When was a Mohican a squaw with seventy winters? No! the white man brings old age with him&mdash;rum is his tomahawk!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, then, do you use it, old man?&rdquo; exclaimed the young hunter; &ldquo;why will one, so noble by nature, aid the devices of the devil by making himself a beast?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
