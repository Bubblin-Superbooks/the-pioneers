It's likely you've been used to a more equal temperature?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am a native of this State,&rdquo; returned Edwards, coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well. I've often heard that point disputed; but it's so easy to get a man naturalized, that it's of little consequence where he was born. I wonder what course the Judge means to take in this business of Natty Bumppo!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
