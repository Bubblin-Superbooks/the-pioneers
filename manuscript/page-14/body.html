<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The whole country was then a wilderness, and it was necessary to transport the bag gage of the troops by means of the rivers&mdash;a devious but practicable route. One brigade ascended the Mohawk until it reached the point nearest to the sources of the Susquehanna, whence it cut a lane through the forest to the head of the Otsego. The boats and baggage were carried over this &ldquo;portage,&rdquo; and the troops proceeded to the other extremity of the lake, where they disembarked and encamped. The Susquehanna, a narrow though rapid stream at its source, was much filled with &ldquo;flood wood,&rdquo; or fallen trees; and the troops adopted a novel expedient to facilitate their passage. The Otsego is about nine miles in length, varying in breadth from half a mile to a mile and a half. The water is of great depth, limpid, and supplied from a thousand springs.</p></div> </div>
