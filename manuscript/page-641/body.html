<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How goes it, how goes it, sheriff?&rdquo; said the wood-chopper; &ldquo;what's the good word in the village?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, much as usual, Billy,&rdquo; returned Richard. &ldquo;But how is this? where are your four kettles, and your troughs, and your iron coolers? Do you make sugar in this slovenly way? I thought you were one of the best sugar-boilers in the county.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm all that, Squire Jones,&rdquo; said Kirby, who continued his occupation; &ldquo;I'll turn my back to no man in the Otsego hills for chopping and logging, for boiling down the maple sap, for tending brick-kiln, splitting out rails, making potash, and parling too, or hoeing corn; though I keep myself pretty much to the first business, seeing that the axe comes most natural to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
