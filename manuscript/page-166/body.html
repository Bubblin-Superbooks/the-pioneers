<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The style of the pedestals as well as the selection of the busts were all due to the taste of Mr. Jones. On one stood Homer, a most striking likeness, Richard affirmed, &ldquo;as any one might see, for it was blind,&rdquo; Another bore the image of a smooth-visaged gentleman with a pointed beard, whom he called Shakespeare. A third ornament was an urn, which; from its shape, Richard was accustomed to say, intended to represent itself as holding the ashes of Dido. A fourth was certainly old Franklin, in his cap and spectacles. A fifth as surely bore the dignified composure of the face of Washington. A sixth was a nondescript, representing &ldquo;a man with a shirt-collar open,&rdquo; to use the language of Richard, &ldquo;with a laurel on his head-it was Julius Caesar or Dr. Faustus; there were good reasons for believing either.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
