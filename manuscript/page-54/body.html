I have a friend who would be uneasy were he to hear that I am hurt and away from him. The injury is but slight, and the bullet has missed the bones; but I believe, sir, you will now admit me title to the venison.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Admit it!&rdquo; repeated the agitated Judge; &ldquo;I here give thee a right to shoot deer, or bears, or anything thou pleasest in my woods, forever. Leather-Stocking is the only other man that I have granted the same privilege to; and the time is coming when it will be of value. But I buy your deer&mdash;here, this bill will pay thee, both for thy shot and my own.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
