When we separated he had such confidence in me that he wished on security, no evidence of the trust, even had there been time or convenience for exacting it. This thou hast heard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most truly, sir,&rdquo; said Edwards, or rather Effingham as we must now call him.</p><p>&ldquo;We differed in politics. If the cause of this country was successful, the trust was sacred with me, for none knew of thy father's interest, if the crown still held its sway, it would be easy to restore the property of so loyal a subject as Colonel Effingham. Is not this plain?'&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
