We must die, Edwards, we must die&mdash;let us do so as Christians. But&mdash;no&mdash;you may yet escape, perhaps. Your dress is not so fatal as mine. Fly! Leave me, An opening may yet be found for you, possibly&mdash;certainly it is worth the effort. Fly! leave me&mdash;but stay! You will see my father! my poor, my bereaved father! Say to him, then, Edwards, say to him, all that can appease his anguish. Tell him that I died happy and collected; that I have gone to my beloved mother; that the hours of this life are nothing when balanced in the scales of eternity. Say how we shall meet again.</p></div> </div>
