Where were the beautiful and fertile vales of the Mohawk? Could they not furnish food for your wants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a season of scarcity; the necessities of life commanded a high price in Europe, and were greedily sought after by the speculators. The emigrants from the East to the West invariably passed along the valley of the Mohawk, and swept away the means of subsistence like a swarm of locusts, Nor were the people on the Flats in a much better condition.
