<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You've driven me to burn these logs, under which I've eaten and drunk&mdash;the first of Heaven's gifts, and the other of the pure springs&mdash;for the half of a hundred years; and to mourn the ashes under my feet, as a man would weep and mourn for the children of his body. You've rankled the heart of an old man, that has never harmed you or your'n, with bitter feelings toward his kind, at a time when his thoughts should be on a better world; and you've driven him to wish that the beasts of the forest, who never feast on the blood of their own families, was his kindred and race; and now, when he has come to see the last brand of his hut, before it is incited into ashes, you follow him up, at midnight, like hungry hounds on the track of a worn-out and dying deer. What more would ye have? for I am here&mdash;one too many. I come to mourn, not to fight; and, if it is God's pleasure, work your will on me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
