Ay, ay, I see it, I see it; here is a man with a pick on his shoulder. So you heard it all, Benjamin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, yes, it was about their minds, I believe, squire,&rdquo; returned the steward; &ldquo;and, by what I can learn, they spoke them pretty plainly to one another. Indeed, I may say that I overheard a small matter of it myself, seeing that the windows was open, and I hard by. But this here is no pick, but an anchor on a man's shoulder; and here's the other fluke down his back, maybe a little too close, which signifies that the lad has got under way and left his moorings.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
