With that armada gay Be laughter loud, and jocund shout&mdash; But with that skill Abides the minstrel tale.&rdquo; &mdash;Lord of the Isles.</p><p>The events of our tale carry us through the summer; and after making nearly the circle of the year, we must conclude our labors in the delightful month of October. Many important incidents had, however, occurred in the intervening period; a few of which it may be necessary to recount.</p><p>The two principal were the marriage of Oliver and Elizabeth, and the death of Major Effingham. They both took place early in September; and the former preceded the latter only a few days. The old man passed away like the last glimmering of a taper; and, though his death cast a melancholy over the family, grief could not follow such an end.</p></div> </div>
