None but a green one would wish to kill a doe with a fa'n by its side, unless his moccasins were getting old, or his leggins ragged, for the flesh is lean and coarse. But a rifle rings among the rocks along the lake shore, sometimes, as if fifty pieces were fired at once&mdash;it would be hard to tell where the man stood who pulled the trigger.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
