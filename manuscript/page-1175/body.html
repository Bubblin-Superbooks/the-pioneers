Will you take charge of it, and see it delivered?&rdquo;</p><p>The Indian raised his head slowly and looked earnestly at the gift, which she put into his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the great enemy of my nation. Without this, when could the white man drive the Delawares? Daughter, the Great Spirit gave your fathers to know how to make guns and powder, that they might sweep the Indians from the land. There will soon be no red-skin in the country. When John has gone, the last will leave these hills, and his family will be dead.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
