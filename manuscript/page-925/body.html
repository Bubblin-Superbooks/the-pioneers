<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How much of this is thine own, Richard, and how much comes from others? I would sift the wheat from the chaff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Part is my own, for I saw the jumper, though it was broken up and burnt in a day or two. I have told you that I saw the old man with his spades and picks. Hiram met Natty, as he was crossing the mountain, the night of his arrival with the sled, and very good-naturedly offered&mdash;Hiram is good-natured&mdash;to carry up part of his load, for the old man had a heavy pull up the back of the mountain, but he wouldn't listen to the thing, and repulsed the offer in such a manner that the squire said he had half a mind to swear the peace against him. Since the snow has been off, more especially after the frosts got out of the ground, we have kept a watchful eye on the gentle man, in which we have found Jotham useful.</p></div> </div>
