I'll never, keep your company agin, sir, if I should live thirty years with the Judge. Sitch talk is more befitting the kitchen than the keeping-room of a house of one who is well-to-do in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look you, Mistress Pitty&mdash;Patty&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Prettybones, mayhap I'm some such matter as a bear, as they will find who come to grapple with me; but dam'me if I'm a monkey&mdash;a thing that chatters without knowing a word of what it says&mdash;a parrot; that will hold a dialogue, for what an honest man knows, in a dozen languages; mayhap in the Bay of State lingo; mayhap in Greek or High Dutch.</p></div> </div>
