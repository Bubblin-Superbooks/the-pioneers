<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It must have been a sight of melancholy pleasure in deed,&rdquo; said Edwards, while his eye roved along the shores and over the hills, where the clearings, groaning with the golden corn, were cheering the forest with the signs of life, &ldquo;to have roamed over these mountains and along this sheet of beautiful water, without a living soul to speak to, or to thwart your humor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven't I said it was cheerful?&rdquo; said Leather-Stocking. &ldquo;Yes, yes, when the trees began to be covered with leaves, and the ice was out of the hake, it was a second paradise. I have travelled the woods for fifty-three years, and have made them my home for more than forty, and I can say that I have met but one place that was more to my liking; and that was only to eyesight, and not for hunting or fishing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
