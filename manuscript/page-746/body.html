Here are a good thousand of the shiners, some hundreds of suckers, and a powerful quantity of other fry. But this is always the way with you, Marmaduke: first it's the trees, then it's the deer; after that it's the maple sugar, and so on to the end of the chapter. One day you talk of canals through a country where there's a river or a lake every half-mile, just because the water won't run the way you wish it to go; and, the next, you say some thing about mines of coal, though any man who has good eyes like myself&mdash;I say, with good eyes&mdash;can see more wood than would keep the city of London in fuel for fifty years; wouldn't it, Benjamin?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
