<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;For God's sake, tell me nothing now, Natty, until we are entirely safe. Where shall we go next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, on the platform of rock over the cave, to be sure; you will be safe enough there, or we'll go Into It, if you be so minded.&rdquo; The young man started, and appeared agitated; but, Looking around him with an anxious eye, said quickly:</p><p>&ldquo;Shalt we be safe on the rock? cannot the fire reach us there, too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can't the boy see?&rdquo; said Natty, with the coolness of one accustomed to the kind of danger he had just encountered. &ldquo;Had ye stayed in the place above ten minutes longer, you would both have been in ashes, but here you may stay forever, and no fire can touch you, until they burn the rocks as well as the woods.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
