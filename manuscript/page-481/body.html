But, as I was saying, I rather guess that times will be altered now in this house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Altered!&rdquo; exclaimed the major-domo, eyeing the bottle, that was assuming the clear aspect of cut glass with astonishing rapidity; &ldquo;it don't matter much, Mistress Remarkable, so long as I keep the keys of the lockers in my pocket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can't say,&rdquo; continued the housekeeper, &ldquo;but there's good eatables and drinkables enough in the house for a body's content&mdash;a little more sugar, Benjamin, in the glass&mdash;for Squire Jones is an excellent provider.
