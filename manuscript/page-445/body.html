I wanted him to turn out a set of harness, and take the cow and the sap troughs. He wouldn't&mdash;but I saw through it; he thought I should have to buy the tacklin' afore I could use the wagon and horses; but I knowed a thing or two myself; I should like to know of what use is the tacklin' to him! I offered him to trade back agin for one hundred and fifty-five. But my woman said she wanted to churn, so I tuck a churn for the change.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
