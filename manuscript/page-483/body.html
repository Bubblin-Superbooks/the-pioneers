<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Promotion should go according to length of sarvice,&rdquo; said the major-domo; &ldquo;and if-so-be that they ship a hand for my berth, or place a new steward aft, I shall throw up my commission in less time than you can put a pilot-boat in stays. The Squire Dickon&rdquo;&mdash;this was a common misnomer with Benjamin&mdash;&ldquo;is a nice gentleman, and as good a man to sail with as heart could wish, yet I shall tel the squire, d'ye see, in plain English, and that's my native tongue, that if-so-be he is thinking of putting any Johnny Raw over my head, why, I shall resign. I began forrard, Mistress Prettybones, and worked my way aft, like a man. I was six months aboard a Garnsey lugger, hauling in the slack of the lee-sheet and coiling up rigging.</p></div> </div>
