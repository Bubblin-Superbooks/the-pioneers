<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ay, summat like it; it was a good half-hour by my own glass, and then there was the time lost in turning it, and some little allowance for leeway in not being over-smart about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Benjamin, this is as long as a Presbyterian; you never could have been ten minutes in turning the glass!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, do you see, Squire, the parson was very solemn, and I just closed my eyes in order to think the better with myself, just the same as you'd put in the dead-lights to make all snug, and when I opened them agin I found the congregation were getting under way for home, so I calculated the ten minutes would cover the leeway after the glass was out. It was only some such matter as a cat's nap.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
