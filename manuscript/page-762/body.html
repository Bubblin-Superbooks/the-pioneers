<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your reasoning is mine; for once, old hunter, we agree in opinion; and I heartily wish we could make a convert of the sheriff. A net of half the size of this would supply the whole village with fish for a week at one haul.&rdquo;</p><p>The Leather-Stocking did not relish this alliance in sentiment; and he shook his head doubtingly as he answered;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no; we are not much of one mind, Judge, or you'd never turn good hunting-grounds into stumpy pastures. And you fish and hunt out of rule; but, to me, the flesh is sweeter where the creatur' has some chance for its life; for that reason, I always use a single ball, even if it be at a bird or a squirrel. Besides, it saves lead; for, when a body knows how to shoot, one piece of lead is enough for all, except hard-lived animals.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
