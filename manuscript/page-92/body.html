<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I believe, my young friend, that terror has driven you from my recollection; your face is very familiar, and yet, for the honor of a score of bucks' tails in my cap, I could not tell your name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I came into the country but three weeks since,&rdquo; returned the youth coldly, &ldquo;and I understand you have been absent twice that time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be five to-morrow. Yet your face is one that I have seen; though it would not be strange, such has been my affright, should I see thee in thy winding-sheet walking by my bedside to-night. What say'st thou, Bess? Am I compos mentis or not? Fit to charge a grand jury, or, what is just now of more pressing necessity, able to do the honors of Christmas eve in the hall of Templeton?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
