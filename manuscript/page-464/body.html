<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why do you sing of your battles, Chingachgook, and of the warriors you have slain, when the worst enemy of all is near you, and keeps the Young Eagle from his rights? I have fought in as many battles as any warrior in your tribe, but cannot boast of my deeds at such a time as this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hawk-eye,&rdquo; said the Indian, tottering with a doubtful step from his place, &ldquo;I am the Great Snake of the Delawares; I can track the Mingoes like an adder that is stealing on the whip-poor-will's eggs, and strike them like the rattlesnake dead at a blow. The white man made the tomahawk of Chingachgook bright as the waters of Otsego, when the last sun is shining; but it is red with the blood of the Maquas.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
