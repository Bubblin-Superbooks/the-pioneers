<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It's better for you, maybe, Billy Kirby,&rdquo; replied the indignant old hunter, &ldquo;and all them that don't know how to put a ball down a rifle-barrel, or how to bring it up again with a true aim; but it's wicked to be shooting into flocks in this wasty manner, and none to do it who know how to knock over a single bird. If a body has a craving for pigeon's flesh, why, it's made the same as all other creatures, for man's eating; but not to kill twenty and eat one. When I want such a thing I go into the woods till I find one to my liking, and then I shoot him off the branches, without touching the feather of another, though there might be a hundred on the same tree. You couldn't do such a thing, Billy Kirby&mdash;you couldn't do it if you tried.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
