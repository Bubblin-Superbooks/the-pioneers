The four corners were garnished with plates of cake. On one was piled certain curiously twisted and complicated figures, called &ldquo;nut-cakes,&rdquo; On another were heaps of a black-looking sub stance, which, receiving its hue from molasses, was properly termed &ldquo;sweet-cake;&rdquo; a wonderful favorite in the coterie of Remarkable, A third was filled, to use the language of the housekeeper, with &ldquo;cards of gingerbread;&rdquo; and the last held a &ldquo;plum-cake,&rdquo; so called from the number of large raisins that were showing their black heads in a substance of suspiciously similar color. At each corner of the table stood saucers, filled with a thick fluid of some what equivocal color and consistence, variegated with small dark lumps of a substance that resembled nothing but itself, which Remarkable termed her &ldquo;sweetmeats.</p></div> </div>
