Even Mohegan seldom came to the mansion-house, and Natty never; but Edwards sought every leisure moment to visit his former abode, from which he would often return in the gloomy hours of night through the snow, or, if detained beyond the time at which the family retired to rest, with the morning sun. These visits certainly excited much speculation in those to whom they were known, but no comments were made, excepting occasionally in whispers from Richard, who would say:</p><p>&ldquo;It is not at all remarkable; a half-breed can never be weaned from the savage ways&mdash;and, for one of his lineage, the boy is much nearer civilization than could, in reason, be expected.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
