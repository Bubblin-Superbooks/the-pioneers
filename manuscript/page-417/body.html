<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A general silence was produced on all but the two speakers, by the following observation from the practitioner of the law:</p><p>&ldquo;So, Dr. Todd, I understand that you have been per forming an important operation this evening by cutting a charge of buckshot from the shoulder of the son of Leather-Stocking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; returned other, elevating his little head with an air of importance. &ldquo;I had a small job up at the Judge's in that way; it was, however, but a trifle to what it might have been, had it gone through the body. The shoulder is not a very vital part; and I think the young man will soon be well. But I did not know that the patient was a son of Leather-Stocking; it is news to me to hear that Natty had a wife.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
