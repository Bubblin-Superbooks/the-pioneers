<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If it's only to get into the cave that ye want, wait till a two hours' sun, and you may enter it in welcome; but come in now you shall not. There's one dead body already, lying on the cold rocks, and there's another in which the life can hardly be said to stay. If you will come in, there'll be dead with out as well as within.&rdquo;</p><p>The wood-chopper stepped out fearlessly from his cover, and cried:</p><p>&ldquo;That's fair; and what's fair is right. He wants you to stop till it's two hours to sundown; and I see reason in the thing. A man can give up when he's wrong, if you don't crowd him too hard; but you crowd a man, and he gets to be like a stubborn ox&mdash;the more you beat, the worse he kicks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
