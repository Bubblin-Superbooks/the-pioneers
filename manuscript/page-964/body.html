He may brag of his aim and his rifle, for he has the best of both, as I will own myself, for sin' he shot the pigeon I knock under to him; but for a wrestle! why, I would take the creatur' between my finger and thumb, and tie him in a bow-knot around my neck for a Barcelony. The man is seventy, and was never anything particular for strength.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He's a deceiving man,&rdquo; said Hiram, &ldquo;like all the hunters; he is stronger than he seems; besides, he has his rifle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That for his rifle!&rdquo; cried Billy; &ldquo;he'd no more hurt me with his rifle than he'd fly. He's a harmless creatur', and I must say that I think he has as good right to kill deer as any man on the Patent.</p></div> </div>
