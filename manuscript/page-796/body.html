Great good-nature, a very tolerable share of skill in his profession, and, considering the circumstances, no contemptible degree of honesty, were the principal ingredients in the character of this man, who was known to the settlers as Squire Van der School, and sometimes by the flattering though anomalous title of the &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; or &ldquo;honest lawyer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
