<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Reach me the scissors,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones, when he had finished, and finished for the second time, after tying the linen in every shape and form that it could be placed; &ldquo;reach me the scissors, for here is a thread that must be cut off, or it might get under the dressings, and inflame the wound. See, John, I have put the lint I scraped between two layers of the linen; for though the bark is certainly best for the flesh, yet the lint will serve to keep the cold air from the wound. If any lint will do it good, it is this lint; I scraped it myself, and I will not turn my back at scraping lint to any man on the Patent. I ought to know how, if anybody ought, for my grandfather was a doctor, and my father had a natural turn that way.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
